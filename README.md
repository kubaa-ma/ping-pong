Simple relaxing game made in C using Raylib library. (Break out Clone)

| Action                           | Key          |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| Move right                      | D            |
| Move Left                       | A            |

## Bugs:
- The ball can sometimes jump out of window, but don’t worry, it came back.
- Collision with squers is not also perfect.

## Development time:
- The game was made in 4 hours of programing time.
